	<h3 id="introduction"><b>Introduction</b></h3>
	
	<p style="text-align: justify;">
        At the moment of finishing a bachelor's or a master's degree, we think that the alarm clocks in the morning, the midnight jobs, the money invested in coffees, the presentations that provokes nervous attacks, and the anguish of knowing the grades are over. You are finally free. In spite of everything, we know that it will not last as long because the learning process of human beings is something that must take place throughout their lives. 
    </p>
    
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        Read, research, study, become interested in a topic, and explore it. All this is what makes us learn and helps us face the different situations that arises, developing intellectual and cultural growth, both personally and professionally. 
    </p>
    
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        Learning is a challenge. You must have an open mind for everything that is to come and that is something that is highly valued in the world of work. It is proven that what one can offer to their company, if they want to learn, will multiply the results of their work. This is because learning is doing. Learning is not knowing about medicine, it is curing the maximum number of patients. Learning is not knowing all the laws during your career, but winning lawsuits. So, imagine how you could change the direction of a company with just a little bit of ambition! 
    </p>
    
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
		Next, we detail a series of reasons why <a href="/" target="_blank"><b>employee training and development</b></a> is important to grow your business.         
    </p>
    
   
    <h3 id="Continuously-Updated"><b>The Team Is Continuously Updated</b></h3>
    
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
		In an era as constantly changing as the one we live in today, any method or tool can become outdated. For this reason, it is essential to have a team that is at the forefront of technology and is interested in learning about all the techniques that come onto the market. In this way, your business would be able to have an up-to-date team that feels comfortable with daily tasks and is not scared by the changes that may occur.         
    </p>
    
    <h3 id="Team-Productivity"><b>Increases Team Productivity</b></h3>
    
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
		If you encourage employee training and development in your company, you can increase the performance of each of your employees. If all the components of a team obtain the same benefits, global satisfaction, effective collective work, and extra motivation to succeed, the set objectives of  your business can be easily achieved. Making your employees realise that they have more skills than they thought improves their performance and, therefore, their contribution to your business.          
    </p>
    
    <h3 id="Image-Company"><b>Improves The Image Of A Company</b></h3>
    
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
		If all the employees working in your company is rewarded with additional training, it will contribute to giving them a better vision of the company's ideals. In this way, a closer link is generated between the employee and your company, where the worker will commit to demonstrating loyalty and trust above all else.          
    </p>
    
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
		As you can see, with an employee of these characteristics, you win from all sides. Do not be afraid when candidates admit that they are eager to learn because this shows that they have all the availability in the world and the intention to improve your business and grow professionally. This could be the next step for your company to continue to scale.          
    </p>
    
    
    <h3 id="Employee-Learning"><b>Why Is Employee Learning So Important For The Growth Of Your Business?</b></h3>

    <ul style="padding-left: 40px;text-align: justify;">
    	<li><b>Improves Competitiveness:</b> The constant updating of knowledge and tools allows your company  to grow at the speed of change.</li><br>
    	<li><b>Increases Commitment:</b> It reinforces the feeling of belonging in employees, favoring motivation and the retention of talent.</li><br>
    	<li><b>Increases Productivity:</b> Motivated and well-trained employees are more efficient in their jobs. They do more tasks in less time and, in addition, they do them better.</li><br>
    	<li><b>Anticipates Solutions:</b> It provides professionals with greater autonomy and the ability to make decisions and solve problems.</li><br>
    	<li><b>Create United Teams:</b> The increase in collaboration and unity of employees helps in forming work teams united for the same purpose.</li><br>
    	<li><b>Transmits Values:</b> It favors equal opportunities and helps to consolidate and transmit the culture, values, and mission of a company.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3 id="Responsibility-Entrepreneur"><b>The Responsibility Of The Entrepreneur With The Development Of Talents</b></h3>
    
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
		It is necessary to understand that the personal development of each employee who is by your side when it comes to promoting your business is a tremendous investment, even if it is in the long term. Therefore, do not waste time and always try to train your team. Employers who only think of technical training are mistaken. It is also necessary to invest in the soft skills.           
    </p>
    
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
		There are several types of training to perfect a work team. From online training to group dynamics, it is necessary to think of the best way to form a capable team, betting above all on the quality of life of each one as a powerful tool to develop the best talents. In addition to that, by showing that you care about every detail of the training of a good professional, you guarantee a good organizational climate. The learning culture is solidified among all and ensures - which can be very important - that the employee wants to work with you, avoiding possible resignations, which would make you lose what you have already invested in.            
    </p>
    
    
    <h3 id="The-Future"><b>The Future</b></h3>
    
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
		Staff development is not just related to productivity. It must also include building an equitable workforce. Responding to the speed of digital transformation, you must teach your employees new technologies and business processes. In fact, employers are increasingly looking for ways to retrain workers with the intention of providing them with opportunities. This focus gives companies the agility to respond to new roles but also promotes diversity and inclusion.            
    </p>
    
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
		As an example, a major African bank has invested in providing skills to every employee - from receptionists to vice presidents - in order to support the effort to become a digital-first company. This broad-based educational approach has enabled the company to accelerate its digital transformation and has created paths for career growth for its workers. A waste treatment company is taking steps to teach skills to its sanitation workers. Its vision is that these workers can become developers or customer service personnel in future.
